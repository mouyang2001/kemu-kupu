Received group allocations on Canvas. I took initiative and found the others on facebook and added them to a messenger group chat so that we could communicate. I also created a shared drive on google drive and we used this to fill out the team contract.

Wednesday 15/09
Organised a zoom meeting where we decided on whose assignment 2 we were going to work off. Callum’s code was the cleanest and most advanced so we decided on his. We also decided on how we were going to divide the work: I would do the front-end and design work, Matthew would implement the majority of the functionality and Callum would do back-end work including java concurrency. After this meeting I designed how the app would flow between screens and what each screen would look like. 

Thursday 16/09
The others looked over my design and I made a few edits according to their feedback, and we set up a github repository for our work.

Friday 17/09
I started working on implementing the code for the design. We discovered that Callum’s code wasn’t designed in a way that made for easy integration with javafx and scenebuilder, so Matthew changed several of the classes.

Saturday 18/09
I implemented the code for the menu and topic choice screens, and also created classes for all the other scenes we would need. On feedback from the group, I cut down the number of scenes that we would use by implementing some conditional functionality. 

Sunday 19/09
We were having a bit of difficulty creating the quiz functionality, so we decided to implement another class to control the quiz and handle the word selection.

Monday 20/09
I finished implementing the design functionality, including having correct/incorrect pop up for a few seconds after submitting a question, an image button to click to replay the sound and some general fix-ups in positioning and sizing. 

Wednesday 22/09
On reviewing the project I found that you did not get a correct/incorrect message on the final question you entered, and festival didn't automatically re-say the word on your second attempt, so I corrected both of these issues.
